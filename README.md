# Pentest Contracts

A small collection of _potentially_ useful contract templates for code auditors, IT security specialists & penetration-testers - or people wanting to contract with the aforementioned and look for inspiration how to set up necessary paperwork.

## What is this?

This is a small collection of contract templates that might be useful in case you are planning to hire a penetration-testing team or, vice versa, are a penetration-tester yourself but don't have any fitting contract templates handy.

All files are presented as [ODT](https://docs.fileformat.com/word-processing/odt/) so you can use open-source software to view and edit them. 

There are currently three files in this repository:

* A **Mutual Non Disclosure Agreement** template [NDA-en.odt](https://github.com/cure53/Contracts/blob/main/NDA-en.odt)
* A **Master Service Agreement** template [MSA-en.odt](https://github.com/cure53/Contracts/blob/main/MSA-en.odt)
* A **Data Protection Addendum** template [DPA-en.odt](https://github.com/cure53/Contracts/blob/main/DPA-en.odt)

## Disclaimer

We are not lawyers. We give no guarantees about any of the documents shared here. They are shared with you because they work for us, have been reviewed by countless lawyers (not us), and that is all we know. 

If you wish to use them for you own purposes, please do so. You may download and customize them as you see it fit. 

But please, **read them and understand them** before using or even signing them.

Comments and tickets about how they can be improved are very welcome. Please don't tell us about file format XYZ that is way better, we know that ODT is not optimal for everyone but that is what we work with, and there are no plans to change that.

And, again, we take no responsibility if you use our templates and something backfires for you or the entities you are signing with. We just share what we usually work with and hope that this helps someone out there :)
